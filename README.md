# Siri

A dark and light theme for the awesome [Zed editor](https://zed.dev). This is a very early version and a work in progress.

## Siri Dark

Siri Dark is basically the default One Dark but with a few tweaks to make it (in my opinion) a little nicer.

## Siri Light

Siri Light is a work in progress. The goal is to make a nice light theme that is not too bright. Right now it has a bluish palette but it might change later on.

## Installation

**Update**: The theme is now included in the Zed theme registry. You can install it from there.

## Font

In the screenshot I'm using the font [JetBrains mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono).

## Siri?

Siri is my dog, btw.
